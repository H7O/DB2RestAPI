# Automatic Database-to-REST API converter

A no-code solution that automatically converts your SQL queries to RESTful APIs without API coding knowledge.

All you need to have is knowledge in writing basic SQL queries and you'll hopefully be on your way building safe and secure REST APIs in minutes.

And although not required, but if you happen to be a .NET developer, you can expand on this solution to add more features / customizations of your liking.

However, for public APIs or B2B APIs with API keys, you can use this solution as is. You'll be surprised how easy it is to build a REST API from a database using the DB-First approach offered by this solution.

## How to use

1. Create a sample database and name it `test`, then run the SQL script below to create a sample `contacts` table within the `test` database that you just created.

> **Note**: Download and install either SQL Server Developer Edition or SQL Server Express if you don't have SQL Server installed on your machine

```sql
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[contacts] (
    [id]    UNIQUEIDENTIFIER CONSTRAINT [DEFAULT_contacts_id] DEFAULT (newid()) NOT NULL,
    [name]  NVARCHAR (500)   NULL,
    [phone] NVARCHAR (100)   NULL,
    [active] [bit] null DEFAULT 1,
    CONSTRAINT [PK_contacts] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED ([id] ASC)
);
```

2. Clone (or download) this repository.
3. Open the solution in Visual Studio.
4. Open the `/config/settings.xml` file and change the default `ConnectionStrings` to point to your `test` database.
5. Run the solution.
6. Download and install [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).
7. Open Postman and create a new request.
8. Set the request method to `POST` (or `GET`).
9. Set the request URL to `https://localhost:<your_custom_port>/hello_world` (e.g., https://localhost:7054/hello_world)
10. Fill `Content-Type` header with `application/json`.
11. Fill the request body with the following JSON:

```json
{
	"name": "John"
}
```
12. Send the request and you should see the following JSON respons: 
```json


    {
        "message_from_db": "hello John! Time now is 2025-10-21 04:47:18.373"
    }

```
13. To see how the API works, change the `name` property in the request body to `Jane` and send the request again. You should see a different response from the database.
14. To see the SQL query that generated the response, open the `/config/sql.xml` file and look for the `hello_world` query. You can change the query to anything you want and the API will still work as long as the query is valid and returns at least a single row.
15. If you examine the `hello_world` query in `/config/sql.xml`, you'll find the use of the `{{name}}` parameter. This parameter is passed from the request body to the query. You can add as many parameters as you want and use them in your queries.
```sql
        declare @name nvarchar(500) = {{name}};


        if (@name is null or ltrim(rtrim(@name)) = '')
        begin
            set @name = 'world';
        end
        select 
        'hello ' + @name + '! Time now is ' + convert(nvarchar(50), getdate(), 121) as message_from_db;
```

The full xml node in `sql.xml` that has the above query defined is as follows:
```xml
    <hello_world>
      <query>
        <![CDATA[
        
        declare @name nvarchar(500) = {{name}};


        if (@name is null or ltrim(rtrim(@name)) = '')
        begin
            set @name = 'world';
        end
        select 
        'hello ' + @name + '! Time now is ' + convert(nvarchar(50), getdate(), 121) as message_from_db;
        
        
        ]]>
      </query>

    </hello_world>
```

> **Note**: Notice that then name of the node `hello_world` is the API endpoint route we're calling in Postman. Later in further examples, we'll see how we can define custom routes to precicely control the route naming conventions instead of just having the xml node name to be the route name as the case in this example.

> **Note**: Passing parameters is safe and secure. The solution is designed to protect against SQL injection attacks by default via utilizing SQL Server's built-in parameterization feature. 
> The SQL parameterization feature is offered by `Com.H.Data.Common` package (available on [Github](https://github.com/H7O/Com.H.Data.Common) / [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Com.H.Data.Common/)).


## Phonebook API examples

### Example 1 - Adding a contact record

Now, let's try to create a new record in the `contacts` table. 
1. To do that, change the request URL to `https://localhost:<your_custom_port>/contacts` and change the request method to `POST`.
2. Fill `Content-Type` header with `application/json`.
3. Fill the request body with the following JSON: 
```json
{
	"name": "John",
	"phone": "1234567890"
}
```
4. Send the request and you should see the following JSON respons: 
```json
{
  "id": "b0b0b0b0-b0b0-b0b0-b0b0-b0b0b0b0b0b0",
  "name": "John",
  "phone": "1234567890",
  "active": 1
}

```
> **Note**: The `id` property is generated by the database and returned by the API. You can use this `id` to update or delete the record later.
> The `id` property is a `GUID` and is generated by the database by default. You can change the `id` property to be an `int` or `bigint` and set it to `IDENTITY` to be auto-incremented by the database.
> The `id` property in the sample response above is just a sample value and not the actual value that you'll get from the API.
5. To see how the API works, change the `name` and `phone` properties in the request body and send the request again. You should see a different response from the database.
6. Try adding multiple records with different names and phone numbers.
8. Try also adding the same name and phone number multiple times. 
You should get an error message from the database saying that the record already exists.
How this error is thrown from the database is up to you. 
The following XML tag in `/config/sql.xml` for `create_contact` illustrates how to throw an error from the database:
```xml
    <create_contact>
      <mandatory_parameters>name,phone</mandatory_parameters>
      <route>contacts</route>
      <verb>POST</verb>
      <success_status_code>201</success_status_code>

      <query>
      <![CDATA[
        declare @name nvarchar(500) = {{name}};
        declare @phone nvarchar(100) = {{phone}};
        declare @active bit = {{active}};
      
        -- check if the contact already exists
      
        declare @existing_contact table 
        (
            id UNIQUEIDENTIFIER,
            name nvarchar(500),
            phone nvarchar(100)
        );
        insert into @existing_contact select top 1 id, name, phone from [contacts] where name = @name and phone = @phone;
      
        declare @error_msg nvarchar(500);
      
        -- return an http 409 error (conflict error) if the contact already exists
      
        if ((select count(*) from [contacts] where name = @name and phone = @phone) > 0)
        begin 
            set @error_msg = 'Contact with name ' + @name + ' and phone ' + @phone + ' already exists';
            -- to return http error code `409 Conflict` throw 50409 and the app will return 409.
            -- same for other http error codes, e.g. 404, 500, etc. Just throw 50404, 50500, etc.
            throw 50409, @error_msg, 1;
            return;
        end
        if (@active is null)
        begin
            set @active = 1;
        end
      
      -- insert new contact, and return it back to the http client
      insert into [contacts] (id, name, phone, active) 
      output inserted.id, inserted.name, inserted.phone, inserted.active
      values (newid(), @name, @phone, @active)
    ]]>
      </query>

      
    </create_contact>
```
Let's breakdown the above XML tags in our `create_contact` node:
- The `mandatory_parameters` tag is optional and used here to specify the mandatory parameters for the query.
- The `route` tag is optional and used here to specify the route for the query (default is `create_contact` if not specified).
- The `verb` tag is optional and used here to specify the HTTP verb for the query (default is any HTTP verb if not specified).
- The `success_status_code` tag is optinal and used to specify the HTTP status code for the query (default is `200 OK` if not specified)
- The `query` tag is mandatory and used here to specify the SQL query to be executed.


> **Mandatory parameters**
You can enforce mandatory parameters in your query by adding them in the `mandatory_parameters` tag.
Mandatory parameters are parameters that must be passed in the HTTP request.
If any of the mandatory parameters are missing, the app will return an HTTP 400 error (bad request error).
The above example shows how to enforce mandatory parameters in the `create_contact` query.
The `name` and `phone` parameters are mandatory.
If any of the mandatory parameters are missing, the app will return an HTTP 400 error (bad request error).

> **Route**
The `route` tag is used to specify the route for the query.
e.g., if you set the `route` tag to `contacts`, the query will be accessible by `https://localhost:<your_custom_port>/contacts`

> **Verb**
The `verb` tag is used to specify the HTTP verb for the query.
e.g., if you set the `verb` tag to `POST`, the query will be accessible by `POST` requests.
If you don't specify it and you have only one unique route, the query will be accessible by any HTTP verb.
If there are multiple routes with the same verb, the app is designed to return the first one.

> **Success status code**
The `success_status_code` tag is used to specify the HTTP status code for the query.
e.g., if you set the `success_status_code` tag to `201`, the query will return an HTTP `201 Created` status code.
If you don't specify it, the app will return `200 OK`.

> **Query**
The `query` tag is used to specify the SQL query to be executed and it's wrapped between `<![CDATA[` and `]]>` tags to prevent XML parsing errors.

> **Error handling**
The app is designed to catch any error with code number between 50000 and 51000 and return it to the client as an HTTP error code between 0 and 1000.<br/>
For example, throwing error code `50409` will be returned to the client as HTTP error code `409` along with the message that you passed to the `throw` statement.<br/>
So basically, the reserved error code range `50000-51000` is mapped to the HTTP error code range `0-1000`.<br/>
Anything outside the reserved error code range `50000-51000` will be returned to the client as HTTP error code `500` with a generic error message of `An error occurred while processing your request.`.<br/>
This is a safety measure to prevent exposing any sensitive information from the database to the client.<br/>

> **Default error message content**
The default error message content can be changed in the `/config/settings.xml` file by changing the `generic_error_message` tag.

> **Debugging SQL errors**<br/>
To debug SQL errors, instead of receiving a generic error message with http error code `500` you can send your request with the `debug-mode` http header filled with a value matching that of the `debug_mode_header_value` tag in `/config/settings.xml` file.<br/>
The `debug_mode_header_value` tag is used to specify the expected value of the `debug-mode` header.<br/>
If the `debug-mode` header is not sent or the value is not matching the `debug_mode_header_value` tag, the app will return a generic error message with http error code `500`.<br/>
If the `debug-mode` header is sent and the value matches the `debug_mode_header_value` tag, the app will return the SQL query that was executed along with the error message in the event of an error.<br/>

### Example 2 - Updating a contact record

Now, let's try to update a record in the `contacts` table.
1. To do that, change the request URL to `https://localhost:<your_custom_port>/contacts/{id}` and change the request method to `PUT`.
2. Fill `Content-Type` header with `application/json`.
3. Fill the request body with the following JSON: 
```json
{
	"name": "John Update 1",
	"phone": "1234567890"
}
```
4. Send the request and you should see the following JSON respons: 
```json

{
  "id": "b0b0b0b0-b0b0-b0b0-b0b0-b0b0b0b0b0b0",
  "name": "John Update 1",
  "phone": "1234567890",
  "active": 1
}

```
The response above shows the updated record.

1. To see how the API works, change the `name` and/or `phone` properties in the request body and send the request again. You should see a different response from the database.
2. Try updating the same record multiple times.
3. Try also updating a record that doesn't exist.
You should get an error message from the database saying that the record doesn't exist.
The error should be returned to the client as HTTP error code 404 (not found error).

Check the `/config/sql.xml` file for the `update_contact` node to see how the `id` parameter is used in the query.

Below is the `update_contact` node in the `/config/sql.xml` file:

```xml
<!-- Contact update endpoint -->
<update_contact>
  <route>contacts/{{id}}</route>
  <verb>PUT</verb>
  
  <mandatory_parameters>id,name,phone</mandatory_parameters>

  <connection_string_name>server2</connection_string_name>
  
  <query>
  <![CDATA[

  -- update contact
  declare @id UNIQUEIDENTIFIER = {{id}};
  declare @name nvarchar(500) = {{name}};
  declare @phone nvarchar(100) = {{phone}};
  
  -- check if contact exists
  
  declare @error_msg nvarchar(500);
  
  -- return an http 404 error (not found error) if the contact does not exist
  
  if ((select count(*) from [contacts] where id = @id) < 1)
  begin 
      set @error_msg = 'Contact with id ' + cast(@id as nvarchar(50)) + ' does not exist';
      -- to return http error code `404 Not found` throw 50404 and the app will return 404.
      throw 50404, @error_msg, 1;
      return;
  end
  
  -- update the contact, and return it back to the http client

  update [contacts] 
  set 
        [name] = @name, 
        phone = @phone 
  output 
    inserted.id, 
    inserted.name, 
    inserted.phone
  where 
    id = @id;      
      
      ]]>
      </query>
    </update_contact>
```

> **connection_string_name**
The `connection_string_name` tag is optional and used to specify the connection string name for the query.
The app is designed to pickup the `default` connection string you define in 
`/config/settings.xml` under `ConnectionStrings` node if you haven't set one here.
However, if you need to access a different database for a specific query,
you can set a different connection string name here, given that you've defined it in `/config/settings.xml` under `ConnectionStrings` node.


### Example 3 - Retrieving contact records along with the total number of records

Now, let's try to retrieve records from the `contacts` table along with the total number of records.
1. To do that, change the request URL to `https://localhost:<your_custom_port>/contacts` and change the request method to `GET`.
1. Fill `Content-Type` header with `application/json`.
1. Send the request and you should see the following JSON respons: 

```json
{
	"count": 3,
	"data": [
		{
			"id": "b0b0b0b0-b0b0-b0b0-b0b0-b0b0b0b0b0b0",
			"name": "John Update 1",
			"phone": "1234567890",
			"active": 1
		},
        {
			"id": "b0b0b0b0-b0b0-b0b0-b0b0-b0b0b0b0b0b1",
			"name": "John Update 2",
			"phone": "1234567890",
			"active": 1
		},
		{
			"id": "b0b0b0b0-b0b0-b0b0-b0b0-b0b0b0b0b0b2",
			"name": "John Update 3",
			"phone": "1234567890",
			"active": 1
		}
	]
}
```

The total number of records is returned in the `count` property in the response.

The records are returned in the `data` property in the response.


Check the `/config/sql.xml` file for the `search_contacts` node to see how the search parameters are used in the query.

```xml
    <!-- Contact search endpoint -->
    <search_contacts>
      <route>contacts</route>
      <verb>GET</verb>
      <query>
        <![CDATA[
        declare @name nvarchar(500) = {{name}};
        declare @phone nvarchar(100) = {{phone}};
        declare @take int = {{take}};
        declare @skip int = {{skip}};
        declare @sort_by nvarchar(50) = {{sort_by}};
        declare @sort_order nvarchar(10) = {{sort_order}};

        if (@sort_by is null or @sort_by = '')
        begin
            set @sort_by = 'name';
        end

        -- default take to 100 if not specified
        if (@take is null or @take < 1)
        begin
            set @take = 100;
        end
        -- make sure max take doesn't exceed 1000
        if (@take > 1000)
        begin
            set @take = 1000;
        end
        -- default skip to 0 if not specified
        if (@skip is null or @skip < 0)
        begin
            set @skip = 0;
        end
        
        
        if (@sort_by is null or @sort_by not in ('name', 'phone'))
        begin
            set @sort_by = 'name';
        end
        
        if (@sort_order is null or @sort_order not in ('asc', 'desc'))
        begin
            set @sort_order = 'asc';
        end


      select * from [contacts] 
        where 
          (@name is null or [name] like '%' +  @name + '%')
          and (@phone is null or [phone] like '%' +  @phone + '%')
        order by 
          case when @sort_by = 'name' and @sort_order = 'asc' then [name] end asc,
          case when @sort_by = 'name' and @sort_order = 'desc' then [name] end desc,
          case when @sort_by = 'phone' and @sort_order = 'asc' then [phone] end asc,
          case when @sort_by = 'phone' and @sort_order = 'desc' then [phone] end desc
        offset @skip rows
        fetch next @take rows only;        
        
        ]]>
      </query>
      <count_query>
        <![CDATA[
        declare @name nvarchar(500) = {{name}};
        declare @phone nvarchar(100) = {{phone}};
        select count(*) from [contacts] 
        where 
          (@name is null or [name] like '%' +  @name + '%')
          and (@phone is null or [phone] like '%' +  @phone + '%');
        
        ]]>
      </count_query>

    </search_contacts>
```
Notice how the above query has two nodes:
- The `query` node is used to return the actual records.
- The `count_query` node is used to return the total number of records that match the search criteria.
- The `count_query` node is optional, if you don't specify it, the app will not return the total count of the results.
- Both `query` and `count_query` nodes have much more functionality than what is shown in the above example. We'll cover them in the next examples.

### Example 4 - Pagination while retrieving contact records

In example 3, we saw how to retrieve records from the `contacts` table along with the total number of records.

Now, let's try to retrieve records from the `contacts` table along with the total number of records while also implementing pagination.

1. To do that, change the request URL to `https://localhost:<your_custom_port>/contacts` and change the request method to `GET`.
2. Fill `Content-Type` header with `application/json`.
3. Fill the request body with the following JSON: 
```json
{
	"take": 3,
	"skip": 0
}
```
4. Send the request and you should see the following JSON respons: 
```json
{
	"count": 20,
	"data": [
		{
			"id": "b0b0b0b0-b0b0-b0b0-b0b0-b0b0b0b0b0b0",
			"name": "John",
			"phone": "1234567890",
			"active": 1
		},
		{
			"id": "b0b0b0b0-b0b0-b0b0-b0b0-b0b0b0b0b0b1",
			"name": "Jane",
			"phone": "3432345567",
			"active": 1
		},
		{
			"id": "b0b0b0b0-b0b0-b0b0-b0b0-b0b0b0b0b0b2",
			"name": "John Doe",
			"phone": "3425167890",
			"active": 1
		}
	]
}
```

The above response shows the first 3 records along with the total number of records that match the search criteria (i.e., our page size is 3 and we're on the first page).

To paginate through the records, you can change the `skip` parameter in the request body to skip a number of records.


Check the `/config/sql.xml` file for the `search_contacts` node to see how the `take` and `skip` parameters are used in the query.

### Example 5 - Searching while retrieving contact records

In example 4, we saw how to retrieve records from the `contacts` table along with the total number of records while also implementing pagination.

Now, let's try to retrieve records from the `contacts` table while also implementing searching.

1. To do that, change the request URL to `https://localhost:<your_custom_port>/contacts` and change the request method to `GET`.
2. Fill `Content-Type` header with `application/json`.
3. Fill the request body with the following JSON: 
```json
{
	"name": "j",
	"take": 3,
	"skip": 0
}
```
4. Send the request and you should see the following JSON respons:
```json
{
	"count": 20,
	"data": [
		{
			"id": "b0b0b0b0-b0b0-b0b0-b0b0-b0b0b0b0b0b0",
			"name": "John",
			"phone": "1234567890",
			"active": 1
		},
		{
			"id": "b0b0b0b0-b0b0-b0b0-b0b0-b0b0b0b0b0b1",
			"name": "Jane",
			"phone": "3432345567", 
			"active": 1
		},
		{
			"id": "b0b0b0b0-b0b0-b0b0-b0b0-b0b0b0b0b0b2",
			"name": "John Doe",
			"phone": "3425167890",
			"active": 1
		}
	]
}
```

The above response shows the first 3 records that match the search criteria (i.e., our page size is 3 and we're on the first page).

To paginate through the records, you can change the `skip` parameter in the request body to skip a number of records.

Check the `/config/sql.xml` file for the `search_contacts` node to see how the `name` parameter is used in the query.

You can also use the `phone` property as a search parameter. The API will return all records that contain the `phone` value in the `phone` column. The search is case-insensitive.

You can also use both `name` and `phone` properties as search parameters. The API will return all records that contain the `name` value in the `name` column and the `phone` value in the `phone` column. The search is case-insensitive.

### Example 6 - Deleting a contact record

Now, let's try to delete a record in the `contacts` table.
1. To do that, change the request URL to `https://localhost:<your_custom_port>/contacts/b0b0b0b0-b0b0-b0b0-b0b0-b0b0b0b0b0b0` and change the request method to `DELETE`.
2. Fill `Content-Type` header with `application/json`.

> **Note**: The above is an example `id` value. You can use any `id` value that you get from the API when you add a new record or retrieve records.

3. Send the request and you should see the following JSON respons: 
```json
[
	{
		"id": "b0b0b0b0-b0b0-b0b0-b0b0-b0b0b0b0b0b0",
		"name": "John Update 1",
		"phone": "1234567890",
		"active": 1
	}
]
```
> **Note**: If the record doesn't exist, you'll get an error message from the database saying that the record doesn't exist.
The error will be returned to the client as HTTP error code 404 (not found error).

Successfully deleted records are returned to the client as HTTP status code 204 (no content).

Check the `/config/sql.xml` file for the `delete_contact` node to see how the `id` parameter is used in the query.

Below is the `delete_contact` node in the `/config/sql.xml` file:

```xml
    <!-- Contact deletion endpoint -->
    <delete_contact>
      <route>contacts/{{id}}</route>
      <verb>DELETE</verb>
      <success_status_code>204</success_status_code>
      <mandatory_parameters>id</mandatory_parameters>
      <query>

        <![CDATA[
        declare @id UNIQUEIDENTIFIER = {{id}};
        -- check if contact exists
        declare @error_msg nvarchar(500);
        -- return an http 404 error (not found error) if the contact does not exist
        if ((select count(*) from [contacts] where id = @id) < 1)
        begin 
            set @error_msg = 'Contact with id ' + cast(@id as nvarchar(50)) + ' does not exist';
            -- to return http error code `404 Not found` throw 50404 and the app will return 404.
            throw 50404, @error_msg, 1;
            return;
        end
        -- delete the contact
        delete from [contacts] 
        OUTPUT DELETED.id, DELETED.name, DELETED.phone, DELETED.active
        where id = @id;
        
        ]]>
      </query>
    </delete_contact>

```

> **Note**: The `id` parameter is a mandatory parameter. If you don't specify it, the app will return an HTTP 400 error (bad request error).

The `verb` tag is set to `DELETE` to indicate that the request is a DELETE request. If the caller's http request is not a DELETE request, the app will return an HTTP 404 error (API endpoint not found error).

The `success_status_code` tag is set to `204` to indicate that the request was successful. If the request was successful, the app will return an HTTP 204 status code (no content).

### Example 8 - Activating / deactivating a contact record

Now, let's try to activate / deactivate a record in the `contacts` table.

1. To do that, change the request URL to `https://localhost:<your_custom_port>/contacts/b0b0b0b0-b0b0-b0b0-b0b0-b0b0b0b0b0b0/deactivate` and change the request method to `PUT`.
2. Fill `Content-Type` header with `application/json`.
3. Send the request and you should see the following JSON respons: 
```json
{
	"id": "b0b0b0b0-b0b0-b0b0-b0b0-b0b0b0b0b0b0",
	"name": "John Update 1",
	"phone": "1234567890",
	"active": 0
}
```

The above response shows the record that was deactivated.

Check the `/config/sql.xml` file for the `activate_deactivate_contact` node to see how the `id` and `status_action` parameters are used in the query.

Below is the `activate_deactivate_contact` node in the `/config/sql.xml` file:

```xml
    <!-- Contact activation/deactivation endpoint -->
    <activate_deactivate_contact>
      <connection_string_name>server2</connection_string_name>
      <route>contacts/{{id}}/{{status_action}}</route>
      <verb>PUT</verb>
      <mandatory_parameters>id</mandatory_parameters>
      <query>
      <![CDATA[

      -- update contact
      declare @id UNIQUEIDENTIFIER = {{id}};
      -- status_action can be either `activate` or `deactivate`
      declare @status_action nvarchar(50) = {{status_action}};

      declare @error_msg nvarchar(500);

      if (@status_action is null or @status_action = ''
      or @status_action not in ('activate', 'deactivate'))
      begin
        set @error_msg = 'Invalid status action';
        throw 50400, @error_msg, 1;
        return;
      end
        
      -- check if contact exists
      
      -- return an http 404 error (not found error) if the contact does not exist
      
      if ((select count(*) from [contacts] where id = @id) < 1)
      begin 
          set @error_msg = 'Contact with id ' + cast(@id as nvarchar(50)) + ' does not exist';
          -- to return http error code `404 Not found` throw 50404 and the app will return 404.
          throw 50404, @error_msg, 1;
          return;
      end
      
      -- update the contact, and return it back to the http client

      declare @status_bit bit = case when @status_action = 'activate' then 1 else 0 end;

      update [contacts] 
      set 
            [active] = @status_bit
      output 
        inserted.id, 
        inserted.name, 
        inserted.phone,
        case when inserted.active = 1 then 'active' else 'inactive' end as status
      where 
        id = @id;      
      ]]>
      </query>
    </activate_deactivate_contact>
```
Notice the `{{action_status}}` parameter in the `route` tag.

The `{{action_status}}` parameter is used to specify the action status.

The `{{action_status}}` parameter can be either `activate` or `deactivate`.

This example showcase how you can create custom rountes that have multiple parameters. And how to use specific parameters for actions (like activate / deactivate in our case) that aren't limited by just the `verb` tag.


### Example 9 - Returning records without count

In example 3, we saw how to retrieve records from the `contacts` table along with the total number of records.

Now, let's try to retrieve records from the `contacts` table without the total number of records.

1. To do that, change the request URL to `https://localhost:<your_custom_port>/contacts_without_count` and change the request method to `GET`.
2. Fill `Content-Type` header with `application/json`.
3. Send the request and you should see the following JSON respons: 
```json
[
  {
    "id": "b0b0b0b0-b0b0-b0b0-b0b0-b0b0b0b0b0b0",
    "name": "John Update 1",
    "phone": "1234567890",
    "active": 1
  },
  {
    "id": "b0b0b0b0-b0b0-b0b0-b0b0-b0b0b0b0b0b1",
    "name": "Jane",
    "phone": "3432345567",
    "active": 1
  },
  {
    "id": "b0b0b0b0-b0b0-b0b0-b0b0-b0b0b0b0b0b2",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "phone": "3425167890",
    "active": 1
  }
]
```

Notice how the response is an array of JSON objects.

Check the `/config/sql.xml` file for the `search_contacts_without_count` node to see how the `response_structure` along with the absense of `count_query` tag is used to return the records without the total number of records.

Below is the `search_contacts_without_count` node in the `/config/sql.xml` file:

```xml
<!-- Contact search without count endpoint -->
    <search_contacts_without_count>
      <route>contacts_without_count</route>
      <verb>GET</verb>

      <!-- default value (if not specified) is `auto`, available options are `auto`, `single` and `array` -->
      <response_structure>array</response_structure>
      <!-- 
      `response_structure` is optional, if you don't specify it, the app defaults to `auto`.
       The possible values are:
       
      1- `array`: instructs the app to return an array of JSON objects for multiple rows response with the following rules:
        a) if the query returned a single row, that row is set to be returned as a json object inside an array
        b) if the query returned multiple rows, the app will return an array of JSON objects with the following structure:
          [
            {
              "id": 1,
              "name": "John",
              "phone": "1234567890"
            },
            {
              "id": 2,
              "name": "Jane",
              "phone": "0987654321"
            }
          ]
        
      2- `single`: instructs the app to return a single JSON object of the first row returned by the query and not iterate over the rest of the rows.
        however, if `count_query` node is specified, the app then is set to return a count structure as per the below structured
        response format but has only the first row returned by the query (i.e., not iterate over the rest of the rows)
      
      3- `auto`: for auto response format (single if single row, array if multiple rows)
      
      **Note**: if `count_query` is specified, the `response_structure` is then ignored as the app 
      is expected to always return a count structure as per the below structured response format:
          {
            "count": 1,
            "data": [
              {
                "id": 1,
                "name": "John",
                "phone": "1234567890"
              }
            ]
          }
      -->      

      <query>
        <![CDATA[
        declare @name nvarchar(500) = {{name}};
        declare @phone nvarchar(100) = {{phone}};
        declare @take int = {{take}};
        declare @skip int = {{skip}};
        declare @sort_by nvarchar(50) = {{sort_by}};
        declare @sort_order nvarchar(10) = {{sort_order}};

        if (@sort_by is null or @sort_by = '')
        begin
            set @sort_by = 'name';
        end

        -- default take to 100 if not specified
        if (@take is null or @take < 1)
        begin
            set @take = 100;
        end
        -- make sure max take doesn't exceed 1000
        if (@take > 1000)
        begin
            set @take = 1000;
        end
        -- default skip to 0 if not specified
        if (@skip is null or @skip < 0)
        begin
            set @skip = 0;
        end
        
        -- validate and default sort parameters (no need for sort by `id` if `id` is GUID, unless your `id` is an incrumental number)
        -- you can also add by create date, update date, etc. but for the purpose of this example, we'll only sort by `name` and `phone`
        if (@sort_by is null or @sort_by not in ('name', 'phone'))
        begin
            set @sort_by = 'name';
        end
        
        if (@sort_order is null or @sort_order not in ('asc', 'desc'))
        begin
            set @sort_order = 'asc';
        end


      select * from [contacts] 
        where 
          (@name is null or [name] like '%' +  @name + '%')
          and (@phone is null or [phone] like '%' +  @phone + '%')
        order by 
          case when @sort_by = 'name' and @sort_order = 'asc' then [name] end asc,
          case when @sort_by = 'name' and @sort_order = 'desc' then [name] end desc,
          case when @sort_by = 'phone' and @sort_order = 'asc' then [phone] end asc,
          case when @sort_by = 'phone' and @sort_order = 'desc' then [phone] end desc
        offset @skip rows
        fetch next @take rows only;        
        
        ]]>
      </query>

    </search_contacts_without_count>    
```

**response_structure**
The `response_structure` tag is optional and used to specify the response structure as being an array or a single object.

The possible values are:<br/>
**1-** `array`: instructs the app to return an array of JSON objects for multiple rows response with the following rules:<br/>
  - **a)** if the query returned a single row, that row is set to be returned as a json object inside an array<br/>
  - **b)** if the query returned multiple rows, the app will return an array of JSON objects with the following structure:<br/>
  ```json
  [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "John",
      "phone": "1234567890",
      "active": 1
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Jane",
      "phone": "0987654321",
      "active": 1
    }
  ]
  ```        
**2-** `single`: instructs the app to return a single JSON object of the first row returned by the query and not iterate over the rest of the rows.<br/>
However, if `count_query` node is specified, the app then is set to return a count structure smiliar to the ones we saw in example 3, 4 and 5.

**3-** `auto`: for auto response format (single if single row, array if multiple rows)

> **Note**: if `count_query` is specified, the `response_structure` is then ignored as the app 
is expected to always return a count structure.

> **Note**: It's preferable to make use of the `response_structure` tag when you don't intend to use the `count_query` but expect to return multiple rows.<br/>
The reason for that is predictability. If you don't specify the `response_structure` tag, the app will default to `auto` which means that if the query returns a single row, the app will return a single object, and if the query returns multiple rows, the app will return an array of objects.<br/>
Callers of your API will have to handle both cases (single row and multiple rows) whereas if you specify the `response_structure` as `array` tag, the app will return an array of objects regardless of the number of rows returned by the query.<br/>

### Example 10 - Protecting your API from unauthorized access

There are two ways to protect your API from unauthorized access:</br>
**1-** Using local API keys (per endpoint)<br/>
**2-** Using global API keys (for all endpoints)<br/>

For global API keys, you can set your API key in `/config/global_api_keys.xml` file.

The `global_api_keys.xml` file structure is as follows:

```xml
<settings>
	<global_api_keys>
		<key>api key 1</key>
		<key>api key 2</key>
	</global_api_keys>
</settings>
```

For local API keys, you can set your API key in the `api_keys` tag in your API node in `/config/sql.xml` file.

The below is an example of a local API key in the `/config/sql.xml` file:

```xml
    <!-- Protected endpoint with local API keys (for global keys, use global_api_keys.xml) -->
    <protected_hello_world>
      <api_keys>
        <key>api key 1</key>
        <key>api key 2</key>
      </api_keys>
      <query>
        <![CDATA[
        declare @name nvarchar(500) = {{name}};
        
        if (@name is null or ltrim(rtrim(@name)) = '')
        begin
            set @name = 'world';
        end
        select 'hello ' + @name + '!' as message_from_db;
        ]]>
      </query>
    </protected_hello_world>
```

Callers of your API will have to send the API key in the `x-api-key` http header.

> **Note**: 
- If you don't specify the `api_keys` tag in your API node, the query will be publically accessible unless you define global api keys in `/config/global_api_keys.xml` file.
- Local API keys take precedence over global API keys if both (global and local) are defined.



### Example 11 - Cached API responses

The solution offers the ability to cache API responses for a specified duration, enhancing performance and reducing latency for frequently accessed data.

To enable this feature, add `cache` node to any of your SQL queries in `sql.xml` file, as shown below:

```xml
    <hello_world_with_cache>
      <cache>
        <memory>
          <duration_in_milliseconds>20000</duration_in_milliseconds>
          <invalidators>name</invalidators>
        </memory>
      </cache>
      <query>
        <![CDATA[
        
        declare @name nvarchar(500) = {{name}};


        if (@name is null or ltrim(rtrim(@name)) = '')
        begin
            set @name = 'world';
        end
        select 'hello ' + @name + '! Time now is ' + convert(nvarchar(50), getdate(), 121) as message_from_db;
        
        
        ]]>
      </query>


    </hello_world_with_cache>

```

In the above example, the `hello_world_with_cache` query is configured to cache its response for 20 seconds. The `invalidators` node specifies the parameters that, when changed, will invalidate the cache and trigger a fresh query execution.

The response will be cached in memory for the specified duration, enhancing performance by eliminating the need to re-execute the query for subsequent requests within the cache's timeframe.

The `Time now is` part of the response is added to demonstrate that the response is indeed cached and not re-executed for subsequent requests within the cache's timeframe.

>**Usage Note:** To leverage the cached API response, simply call the API as usual. The solution will automatically cache the response based on the specified duration and invalidators.<br/>
Try changing the `name` parameter in the request body and sending the request multiple times within the cache's timeframe. You should see the same response with the same timestamp, indicating that the response is cached and not re-executed.

>**Note**: The `invalidators` node is optional and can be used to invalidate the cache when the specified parameters change.


### Example 12 - Nested JSON with SQL Server FOR JSON

When working with relational databases, you often need to return hierarchical or nested data structures. SQL Server's `FOR JSON PATH` clause allows you to generate JSON from SQL queries, but by default, SQL Server returns nested JSON as an escaped string rather than a proper JSON object.

This solution provides a **JSON type decorator** that automatically parses these JSON strings and embeds them as proper nested objects in your API response, eliminating the need for additional client-side parsing.

#### The problem

Consider this SQL query that returns contacts with their phone numbers using `FOR JSON PATH`:

```sql
SELECT
    name,
    (
        SELECT phone
        FROM contacts c2
        WHERE c2.name = c1.name AND c2.active = 1
        FOR JSON PATH
    ) AS phones,
    1 AS active
FROM contacts c1
WHERE c1.active = 1
GROUP BY name;
```

**Without the JSON type decorator**, SQL Server returns the `phones` field as an escaped JSON string:

```json
[
    {
        "name": "Bob Johnson",
        "phones": "[{\"phone\":\"+1-555-0103\"},{\"phone\":\"+1-555-0104\"}]",
        "active": 1
    },
    {
        "name": "Jane Smith",
        "phones": "[{\"phone\":\"+1-555-0102\"}]",
        "active": 1
    }
]
```

Notice how `phones` is a string containing escaped JSON characters (`\"`) rather than a proper JSON array.

Clients would need to call `JSON.parse()` on the `phones` field to work with it as an object:

```javascript
// Client-side workaround without decorator
const data = await fetch('/contacts').then(r => r.json());
data.forEach(contact => {
    contact.phones = JSON.parse(contact.phones); // Manual parsing required!
});
```

#### The solution: JSON type decorator

Add the `{type{json{field_name}}}` decorator to automatically parse JSON string fields into proper objects:

```xml
<nested_json>
  <query>
    <![CDATA[
      SELECT
          name,
          (
              SELECT phone
              FROM contacts c2
              WHERE c2.name = c1.name AND c2.active = 1
              FOR JSON PATH
          ) AS {type{json{phones}}},
          1 AS active
      FROM contacts c1
      WHERE c1.active = 1
      GROUP BY name;
    ]]>
  </query>
</nested_json>
```

**With the `{type{json{phones}}}` decorator**, the API automatically returns properly nested JSON:

```json
[
    {
        "name": "Bob Johnson",
        "phones": [
            {
                "phone": "+1-555-0103"
            },
            {
                "phone": "+1-555-0104"
            }
        ],
        "active": 1
    },
    {
        "name": "Jane Smith",
        "phones": [
            {
                "phone": "+1-555-0102"
            }
        ],
        "active": 1
    }
]
```

Now `phones` is a proper JSON array that clients can use directly without additional parsing!

```javascript
// Client-side code with decorator - no manual parsing needed!
const data = await fetch('/nested_json').then(r => r.json());
data.forEach(contact => {
    contact.phones.forEach(phoneObj => {
        console.log(phoneObj.phone); // Works directly!
    });
});
```

#### How it works

The `{type{json{field_name}}}` decorator tells the API engine to:
1. Recognize that the specified field contains a JSON string
2. Parse the JSON string during response serialization
3. Embed it as a proper nested object/array in the final response

This happens automatically on the server side, so your API consumers receive clean, properly structured JSON without any extra work.

#### Multiple nested fields

You can use the decorator for multiple fields in the same query:

```sql
SELECT
    name,
    (
        SELECT phone, type
        FROM phones
        WHERE contact_id = c.id
        FOR JSON PATH
    ) AS {type{json{phones}}},
    (
        SELECT street, city, country
        FROM addresses
        WHERE contact_id = c.id
        FOR JSON PATH
    ) AS {type{json{addresses}}},
    active
FROM contacts c
WHERE active = 1;
```

Both `phones` and `addresses` will be returned as proper JSON arrays in the response.

#### Benefits

✅ **Cleaner API responses** - Proper JSON structure without escaped strings  
✅ **Better client experience** - No manual `JSON.parse()` calls needed  
✅ **Type safety** - IDEs and TypeScript can infer proper types  
✅ **Reduced errors** - Eliminates parsing errors on the client side  
✅ **Performance** - Parsing happens once on the server instead of on every client  

> **Note**: This feature leverages the `Com.H.Text.Json` package which provides advanced JSON serialization capabilities including the type decorator syntax. The decorator works seamlessly with SQL Server's `FOR JSON PATH`, `FOR JSON AUTO`, and any other scenario where you need to embed JSON strings as proper objects.


### Example 13 - Acting as an API gateway

The solution also offers the feature of acting as an API gateway to seamlessly route requests to various other APIs.

This capability is helpful for consolidating a multitude of APIs under a single, unified base URL. 

Consumers benefit without needing to delve into the intricacies of where the data originates&mdash;be it from direct database calls or external APIs routed through the solution.

Moreover, in this setup, uniform API key enforcement becomes easy to manage. Whether interfacing with local resources or external services, the solution can enforce consistent API key usage, even if the external APIs don't inherently require such authentication.

To implement this functionality, we can utilize a setup file, `api_gateway.xml`, located within the config folder, to configure route mappings to different APIs.

Here's the structure of the `api_gateway.xml` file:

```xml
<settings>
  <routes>
    <cat_facts>
      <url>https://catfact.ninja/fact</url>
      <excluded_headers>x-api-key,host</excluded_headers>
    </cat_facts>
  </routes>
</settings>
```

The <routes> node contains a collection of customizable route configurations.

Consider the `cat_facts` route as an illustration:

```xml
<cat_facts>
	<url>https://catfact.ninja/fact</url>
	<excluded_headers>x-api-key,host</excluded_headers>
</cat_facts>
```

In this example:

* The `<cat_facts>` node denotes the route's name, which can be tailored as needed, this is the name you'll use to call the API (e.g., `https://localhost:<your_custom_port>/cat_facts`).
* The `<url>` node specifies the destination URL for routing the request.
* Optionally, the `<excluded_headers>` node allows exclusion of specific headers from the request before routing (i.e., `x-api-key,host` in this example won't be passed to the destination URL).

The app automatically directs requests to the designated external or local APIs based on the specified routes in `api_gateway.xml` and/or SQL queries outlined in `sql.xml`. Additionally, it automatically filters out the designated headers from the request before routing, optimizing compatibility and security.

By offering to exclude headers selectively, the solution safeguards against exposing sensitive data to external APIs while circumventing potential routing issues caused by extraneous headers. For instance, preemptively removing the `host` header prevents TLS handshake errors during routing, while omitting the `x-api-key` header shields our solution's API key from exposure to external services.

Optionally, the `ignore_certificate_errors` node permits bypassing certificate validation errors during API request routing, enhancing flexibility and compatibility.

### Example 14 - Protecting your API routes from unauthorized access

You can protect your API routes from unauthorized access by adding the `api_keys` tag to your API node in `api_gateway.xml` file just as we did in example 10 with the `api_keys` tag in `sql.xml` file.

Here is a sample of a protected route in `api_gateway.xml` file:

```xml
    <!-- 
    adds API Keys protection to to the unprotected `catfact.ninja/fact` API
    before routing
    -->
    <locally_protected_cat_facts>
      <api_keys>
        <key>local api key 1</key>
        <key>local api key 2</key>
      </api_keys>

      <url>https://catfact.ninja/fact</url>
      <excluded_headers>x-api-key,host</excluded_headers>
    </locally_protected_cat_facts>
```
With the above configuration, callers to the `https://localhost:7054/locally_protected_cat_facts` API will have to send the API key in the `x-api-key` http header.

> **Note**: If you don't specify the `api_keys` tag in your API node, the route will be publically accessible unless you define global api keys in `/config/global_api_keys.xml` file.

### Example 15 - Custom endpoint path

You can customize the endpoint path by adding the `route` tag to your API node in `api_gateway.xml` file just as we did with the `route` tag in `sql.xml` file.

Here is a sample of a custom endpoint path in `api_gateway.xml` file:

```xml
    <!-- 
    Callers to this API will use the path `cat/facts` (e.g., https://localhost:7054/cat/facts)
    will get routed to the `https://catfact.ninja/fact` API.
    -->
    <cat_facts_custom_path_example>
      <route>cat/facts/list</route>
      <url>https://catfact.ninja/fact</url>
      <excluded_headers>x-api-key,host</excluded_headers>
    </cat_facts_custom_path_example>
```

The above endpoint path will be accessible at `https://localhost:7054/cat/facts/list` and will be routed to the `https://catfact.ninja/fact` API.

### Example 16 - Wildcard route matching

You can use wildcard route matching to route multiple endpoints to single base URL by using the `*` wildcard character.

Here is a sample of a wildcard route matching in `api_gateway.xml` file:

```xml
    <cat_facts_wildcard_path_example>
      <route>cat/*</route>
      <url>https://catfact.ninja/</url>
      <excluded_headers>x-api-key,host</excluded_headers>
    </cat_facts_wildcard_path_example>
```

Any API call that starts with `cat/` will be routed to the `https://catfact.ninja/` API.

The remaining part of the path will be appended to the base URL.

For example, if you call `https://localhost:7054/cat/facts/list`, it will be routed to the `https://catfact.ninja/facts/list` API.

This is helpful when you have multiple endpoints that share the same base URL but have different paths. Instead of creating multiple routes, you can use a single route with a wildcard character to match the different paths.

> **Note**: The `*` wildcard character can be used to match any number of characters.

### Example 17 - Caching API gateway responses

Just like database queries, API gateway routes can also benefit from caching to improve performance and reduce load on target APIs.

The caching feature for API gateway routes works by storing the complete HTTP response (including status code, headers, and body) in memory for a specified duration. This is particularly useful for:
- Reducing latency for frequently accessed external APIs
- Protecting downstream services from high traffic
- Continuing to serve responses during temporary outages of target APIs
- Reducing costs when using metered external APIs

#### How it works

The cache key is automatically generated from:
- HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
- Resolved route path (after wildcard matching)
- Query string parameters (from the caller)
- Request headers
- Configured invalidators

This means that different HTTP methods, different query parameters, or different header values will create separate cache entries, giving you granular control over what gets cached.

#### Configuration example

Add a `cache` section to your route in `/config/api_gateway.xml`:

```xml
<cat_facts_with_cache>
  <route>cat/facts</route>
  <url>https://catfact.ninja/fact</url>
  <excluded_headers>x-api-key,host</excluded_headers>

  <cache>
    <memory>
      <!-- Cache duration in milliseconds (20 seconds in this example) -->
      <duration_in_milliseconds>20000</duration_in_milliseconds>
      
      <!-- Parameters that invalidate cache (comma-separated) -->
      <!-- The system looks for these in both query parameters and headers -->
      <invalidators>category,limit</invalidators>
      
      <!-- Optional: Don't cache these HTTP status codes (comma-separated) -->
      <!-- By default, ALL status codes are cached (including errors) -->
      <!-- This protects your target API during outages or high traffic -->
      <exclude_status_codes_from_cache>401,403,429</exclude_status_codes_from_cache>
      
      <!-- Optional: Max size per invalidator value in characters (default: 1000) -->
      <max_per_value_cache_size>1000</max_per_value_cache_size>
    </memory>
  </cache>
</cat_facts_with_cache>
```

#### Testing the cache

1. Call the API endpoint twice with the same parameters:
```bash
# First call - response is fetched from target API and cached
curl https://localhost:7054/cat/facts

# Second call within 20 seconds - response served from cache (much faster!)
curl https://localhost:7054/cat/facts
```

2. Change the invalidator parameter to create a different cache entry:
```bash
# This creates a new cache entry because 'category' is different
curl https://localhost:7054/cat/facts?category=funny
```

3. Try different HTTP methods:
```bash
# GET and POST create separate cache entries even with same parameters
curl -X GET https://localhost:7054/cat/facts
curl -X POST https://localhost:7054/cat/facts
```

#### Cache invalidators

The `invalidators` configuration specifies which parameters should be included in the cache key. The system will look for these parameters in:
- **Query string parameters**: `?category=funny&limit=10`
- **Request headers**: `X-Tenant-Id`, `Authorization`, etc.

If a parameter specified in `invalidators` changes, a new cache entry is created.

**Example**: With `<invalidators>category,tenant_id</invalidators>`:
- `/cat/facts?category=funny` → Cache entry A
- `/cat/facts?category=sad` → Cache entry B (different category)
- `/cat/facts?category=funny` with header `X-Tenant-Id: 123` → Cache entry C (different tenant)

Parameters **not** listed in `invalidators` are ignored for caching purposes but still passed to the target API.

#### Status code filtering

By default, **all HTTP status codes are cached**, including errors like 404, 500, 502, etc. This design decision protects your target APIs during:
- High traffic periods
- Temporary outages
- Rate limiting scenarios

However, you can exclude specific status codes from being cached:

```xml
<!-- Don't cache authentication/authorization errors and rate limits -->
<exclude_status_codes_from_cache>401,403,429</exclude_status_codes_from_cache>
```

**Why cache error responses?**
- A 404 error during high traffic might indicate the target API is overwhelmed
- A 500 error might be temporary, and caching it reduces load on the failing service
- It gives the target API time to recover while still serving responses

**When to exclude status codes:**
- 401/403: Authentication errors that should be re-evaluated on each request
- 429: Rate limiting errors where you want to retry immediately
- Any status code where you need real-time verification

#### Performance considerations

**Without caching:**
- Every request is proxied to the target API
- Response is streamed directly to the client
- Optimal for single requests, but no protection during high traffic

**With caching:**
- First request: Response is buffered in memory and cached
- Subsequent requests (within cache duration): Served instantly from memory
- Expired/invalidated requests: Fall back to buffering and caching again

**Routes without cache configuration continue to stream responses directly** (backward compatible).

#### Complete example

Here's a practical example using a weather API:

```xml
<weather_with_cache>
  <route>weather/current</route>
  <url>https://api.weather.com/v1/current</url>
  <excluded_headers>x-api-key,host</excluded_headers>
  
  <!-- Override the API key header for the target API -->
  <applied_headers>
    <header>
      <name>X-API-Key</name>
      <value>your-weather-api-key-here</value>
    </header>
  </applied_headers>

  <cache>
    <memory>
      <!-- Cache for 5 minutes (weather doesn't change that often) -->
      <duration_in_milliseconds>300000</duration_in_milliseconds>
      
      <!-- Different cities and units create different cache entries -->
      <invalidators>city,units</invalidators>
      
      <!-- Don't cache authentication errors or service unavailable -->
      <exclude_status_codes_from_cache>401,403,503</exclude_status_codes_from_cache>
    </memory>
  </cache>
</weather_with_cache>
```

Usage:
```bash
# First call for London - hits the API, caches for 5 minutes
curl "https://localhost:7054/weather/current?city=London&units=metric"

# Subsequent calls for London within 5 minutes - served from cache
curl "https://localhost:7054/weather/current?city=London&units=metric"

# Different city - creates new cache entry
curl "https://localhost:7054/weather/current?city=Paris&units=metric"
```

> **Note**: The cache is stored in memory using ASP.NET Core's `HybridCache` feature, which provides high-performance caching with minimal overhead. All cached objects are automatically serialized and deserialized, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval.

> **Important**: Cache durations should be chosen based on how frequently the data changes and your performance requirements. Shorter durations mean more up-to-date data but more requests to the target API. Longer durations mean better performance but potentially stale data.


## File Upload Feature

The solution provides built-in support for file uploads with both `application/json` (base64-encoded files) and `multipart/form-data` content types. Files can be automatically stored in local file systems, SFTP servers, or both simultaneously.

### Prerequisites - File Stores Configuration

Before using file upload endpoints, you need to configure your file stores in `/config/file_management.xml`:

```xml
<settings>
  <file_management>
    <!-- Define the path structure for stored files -->
    <relative_file_path_structure>{date{yyyy}}/{date{MMM}}/{date{dd}}/{{guid}}/{file{name}}</relative_file_path_structure>
    
    <!-- Global file restrictions (can be overridden per endpoint) -->
    <permitted_file_extensions>.txt,.pdf,.docx,.xlsx,.png,.jpg,.jpeg</permitted_file_extensions>
    <max_number_of_files>5</max_number_of_files>
    <max_file_size_in_bytes>314572800</max_file_size_in_bytes> <!-- 300 MB -->
    
    <!-- Configure local file stores -->
    <local_file_store>
      <primary>
        <base_path><![CDATA[c:\myfiles\]]></base_path>
      </primary>
      <backup>
        <base_path><![CDATA[d:\backup\]]></base_path>
        <optional>true</optional> <!-- Won't fail request if this store fails -->
      </backup>
    </local_file_store>
    
    <!-- Configure SFTP file stores (you can have multiple) -->
    <sftp_file_store>
      <remote_storage>
        <host><![CDATA[sftp.example.com]]></host>
        <port>22</port>
        <username><![CDATA[your_username]]></username>
        <password><![CDATA[your_password]]></password>
        <base_path><![CDATA[/uploads/]]></base_path>
      </remote_storage>
      <offsite_backup>
        <host><![CDATA[backup.example.com]]></host>
        <port>2222</port>
        <username><![CDATA[backup_user]]></username>
        <password><![CDATA[backup_pass]]></password>
        <base_path><![CDATA[/backups/documents/]]></base_path>
        <optional>true</optional> <!-- Won't fail request if this store fails -->
      </offsite_backup>
    </sftp_file_store>
  </file_management>
</settings>
```

### Database Schema for File Metadata

Create a `files` table to store file metadata:

```sql
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[files] (
    [id]            UNIQUEIDENTIFIER NOT NULL,
    [contact_id]    UNIQUEIDENTIFIER NOT NULL,
    [file_name]     NVARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    [relative_path] NVARCHAR(1000) NOT NULL,
    [description]   NVARCHAR(1000) NULL,
    CONSTRAINT [PK_files] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED ([id] ASC),
    CONSTRAINT [FK_files_contacts] FOREIGN KEY ([contact_id]) 
        REFERENCES [dbo].[contacts] ([id]) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

### Example - Creating a Contact with File Attachments

Let's create an endpoint that creates a contact record and attaches files (e.g., ID documents, photos):

**Configuration in `/config/sql.xml`:**

```xml
<create_contact_with_files>
  <mandatory_parameters>name,phone</mandatory_parameters>
  <route>v2/contacts</route>
  <verb>POST</verb>
  <success_status_code>201</success_status_code>
  
  <file_management>
    <!-- Reference the stores defined in file_management.xml -->
    <stores>primary, backup, remote_storage, offsite_backup</stores>
    
    <!-- Override global settings for this endpoint -->
    <permitted_file_extensions>.txt,.pdf,.png,.jpg,.jpeg</permitted_file_extensions>
    <max_file_size_in_bytes>10485760</max_file_size_in_bytes> <!-- 10 MB -->
    <max_number_of_files>3</max_number_of_files>
    
    <!-- Specify the JSON field/form field name for file metadata -->
    <files_json_field_or_form_field_name>attachments</files_json_field_or_form_field_name>
    
    <!-- Set to false if you only need metadata in SQL (not file content) -->
    <pass_files_content_to_query>false</pass_files_content_to_query>
  </file_management>
  
  <query>
  <![CDATA[
    USE [test]

        RETURN;
    END
    
    -- Tables to hold results
    DECLARE @new_contact TABLE (
        id UNIQUEIDENTIFIER,
        name NVARCHAR(500),
        phone NVARCHAR(100),

    );
    
    BEGIN TRANSACTION;
    BEGIN TRY
        -- Insert new contact
        INSERT INTO [contacts] (id, name, phone, active)
        OUTPUT inserted.id, inserted.name, inserted.phone, inserted.active
        INTO @new_contact
        VALUES (NEWID(), @name, @phone, @active);
        
        -- Parse file metadata from JSON
        INSERT INTO @files (id, file_name, relative_path, description)
        SELECT 
            JSON_VALUE(value, '$.id'),
            JSON_VALUE(value, '$.file_name'),
            JSON_VALUE(value, '$.relative_path'),
            JSON_VALUE(value, '$.description')
        FROM OPENJSON(@files_json);
        
        -- Link files to contact
        UPDATE @files 
        SET contact_id = (SELECT id FROM @new_contact);
        
        -- Save file metadata to database
        INSERT INTO [files] (id, contact_id, file_name, relative_path, description)
        SELECT id, contact_id, file_name, relative_path, description
        FROM @files;
        
        COMMIT TRANSACTION;
    END TRY
    BEGIN CATCH
        ROLLBACK TRANSACTION;
        THROW;
    END CATCH
    
    -- Return contact with attached files
    SELECT 
        nc.id,
        nc.name,
        nc.phone,
        nc.active,
        (
            SELECT id, file_name, relative_path, description
            FROM @files
            FOR JSON PATH
        ) AS {type{json{files}}}
    FROM @new_contact nc;
  ]]>
  </query>
</create_contact_with_files>
```

### Usage Examples

#### Method 1: Using `application/json` with Base64-Encoded Files

This method is ideal when you already have files as base64 strings (e.g., from a web form or mobile app):

**Request:**
```bash
POST https://localhost:7054/v2/contacts
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "phone": "+1-555-0100",
  "active": true,
  "attachments": [
    {
      "file_name": "drivers_license.jpg",
      "base64_content": "/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQEAYABgAAD...",
      "description": "Driver's License - Front"
    },
    {
      "file_name": "proof_of_address.pdf",
      "base64_content": "JVBERi0xLjQKJeLjz9MKMyAwIG9iago8P...",
      "description": "Utility Bill"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "a3d5e7f9-1234-5678-90ab-cdef12345678",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "phone": "+1-555-0100",
  "active": true,
  "files": [
    {
      "id": "b1c2d3e4-5678-90ab-cdef-1234567890ab",
      "file_name": "drivers_license.jpg",
      "relative_path": "2025/Nov/11/b1c2d3e4-5678-90ab-cdef-1234567890ab/drivers_license.jpg",
      "description": "Driver's License - Front"
    },
    {
      "id": "c2d3e4f5-6789-01bc-def1-234567890abc",
      "file_name": "proof_of_address.pdf",
      "relative_path": "2025/Nov/11/c2d3e4f5-6789-01bc-def1-234567890abc/proof_of_address.pdf",
      "description": "Utility Bill"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Method 2: Using `multipart/form-data`

This method is better for traditional file uploads from HTML forms or when dealing with large files:

**Request:**
```bash
POST https://localhost:7054/v2/contacts
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundary7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW

------WebKitFormBoundary7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="name"

John Doe
------WebKitFormBoundary7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="phone"

+1-555-0100
------WebKitFormBoundary7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="active"

true
------WebKitFormBoundary7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="attachments"
Content-Type: application/json

[
  {
    "file_name": "drivers_license.jpg",
    "description": "Driver's License - Front"
  },
  {
    "file_name": "proof_of_address.pdf",
    "description": "Utility Bill"
  }
]
------WebKitFormBoundary7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="drivers_license.jpg"
Content-Type: image/jpeg

[binary file content]
------WebKitFormBoundary7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="proof_of_address.pdf"
Content-Type: application/pdf

[binary file content]
------WebKitFormBoundary7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW--
```

**Using Postman:**
1. Set request method to `POST` and URL to `https://localhost:7054/v2/contacts`
2. Select the **Body** tab
3. Select **form-data** radio button
4. Add text fields: `name`, `phone`, `active`
5. Add a `attachments` field with value:
   ```json
   [
     {"file_name": "drivers_license.jpg", "description": "Driver's License - Front"},
     {"file_name": "proof_of_address.pdf", "description": "Utility Bill"}
   ]
   ```
6. Add file fields by changing dropdown from "Text" to "File" and select files

### How It Works

1. **File Upload**: When you send the request, files are temporarily stored in the system's temp directory
2. **Validation**: The system validates file extensions, sizes, and counts against your configuration
3. **Storage**: Files are copied to all configured stores (local and/or SFTP) in parallel
4. **Metadata Generation**: The system generates:
   - A unique GUID for each file (if not provided)
   - Relative path based on the configured structure (e.g., `2025/Nov/11/{guid}/filename.ext`)
   - File extension and size information
5. **SQL Processing**: Your SQL query receives the enriched metadata as JSON
6. **Cleanup**: Temporary files are automatically cleaned up after the request completes
7. **Transaction Safety**: If any mandatory store fails, the entire transaction rolls back

### Advanced Features

**Optional Stores**: Mark stores (local or SFTP) as optional to prevent failures if a secondary storage location is unavailable:
```xml
<local_file_store>
  <backup>
    <base_path><![CDATA[d:\backup\]]></base_path>
    <optional>true</optional> <!-- Request won't fail if this store is unavailable -->
  </backup>
</local_file_store>
```

**Custom File Path Structure**: Customize how files are organized using date patterns and GUIDs:
```xml
<relative_file_path_structure>{date{yyyy}}/{date{MMM}}/{date{dd}}/{{guid}}/{file{name}}</relative_file_path_structure>
<!-- Results in: 2025/Nov/11/a3d5e7f9-1234-5678-90ab-cdef12345678/document.pdf -->
```

**Pass File Content to SQL**: If you need file content in your SQL query (e.g., for virus scanning or database storage):
```xml
<pass_files_content_to_query>true</pass_files_content_to_query>
```

This adds a `base64_content` field to the JSON passed to your query.

**Custom Field Names**: Match your existing API contracts:
```xml
<filename_field_in_payload>fileName</filename_field_in_payload>
<base64_content_field_in_payload>fileContent</base64_content_field_in_payload>
<files_json_field_or_form_field_name>documents</files_json_field_or_form_field_name>
```

> **Security Note**: The file upload feature includes built-in protection against path traversal attacks and validates file extensions to prevent malicious uploads. Always configure `permitted_file_extensions` to whitelist only the file types your application needs.

> **Performance Note**: File uploads are processed asynchronously with optimized I/O operations. Large files are streamed rather than loaded entirely into memory. For production deployments, consider implementing virus scanning and additional validation in your SQL procedures.


## File Download Feature

The solution provides seamless file download capabilities with support for multiple storage sources: database storage (base64), local file systems, SFTP servers, and HTTP/HTTPS URLs. Files are streamed efficiently to handle large downloads without consuming excessive memory.

### How File Downloads Work

When a request is made to a download endpoint:
1. Your SQL query returns metadata about the file (name, location, content type)
2. The system determines the file source (database, local store, SFTP, or HTTP)
3. The file is streamed directly to the client with appropriate headers
4. Large files are handled efficiently with async streaming

### File Source Priority

If multiple sources are provided, the system prioritizes in this order:
1. **`base64_content`** - File content stored in the database
2. **`relative_path`** - File stored in a file store (local or SFTP)
3. **`http`** - File proxied from an HTTP/HTTPS URL

### Example - Document Download Endpoint

Let's create an endpoint to download files that were uploaded with the contact records:

**Configuration in `/config/sql.xml`:**

```xml
<download_document>
  <route>documents/{{id}}</route>
  <verb>GET</verb>
  <mandatory_parameters>id</mandatory_parameters>
  
  <!-- Setting response_structure to 'file' enables file download mode -->
  <response_structure>file</response_structure>
  
  <file_management>
    <!-- Specify which store to download from (must match upload store name) -->
    <!-- Note: 'store' is only required when using 'relative_path' to locate files.
         For 'base64_content' or 'http' sources, the store configuration is optional
         and can be omitted entirely. -->
    <store>primary</store>
    <!-- Note: Unlike upload which uses 'stores' (plural) for multiple destinations,
         download uses 'store' (singular) as files are retrieved from one location -->
  </file_management>
  
  <query>
  <![CDATA[
    USE [test]
    
    DECLARE @id UNIQUEIDENTIFIER = {{id}};
    
    -- Check if file exists
    IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM [files] WHERE id = @id)
    BEGIN
        DECLARE @err NVARCHAR(200) = 'No document found with id ' + CONVERT(NVARCHAR(50), @id);
        THROW 50404, @err, 1; -- Returns HTTP 404 Not Found
        RETURN;
    END
    
    -- Return file metadata
    -- The system needs at least one of: base64_content, relative_path, or http
    SELECT 
        file_name,              -- Name for the downloaded file
        relative_path,          -- Path in the file store
        -- base64_content,      -- Uncomment if file content is stored in DB
        -- 'application/pdf' AS content_type  -- Optional: specify MIME type
        -- 'https://example.com/file.pdf' AS http  -- Optional: proxy from URL
    FROM [files]
    WHERE id = @id;
  ]]>
  </query>
</download_document>
```

### SQL Query Response Fields

Your query should return a single row with these fields:

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `file_name` | Recommended | Filename for download. Falls back to filename from `relative_path` or "downloaded_file" |
| `base64_content` | Conditional* | Base64-encoded file content (for database-stored files) |
| `relative_path` | Conditional* | Path to file in the configured store |
| `http` | Conditional* | HTTP/HTTPS URL to proxy the file from |
| `content_type` | Optional | MIME type (e.g., `application/pdf`). Auto-detected from extension if omitted |

*At least one content source (`base64_content`, `relative_path`, or `http`) must be provided.

### Usage Examples

#### Basic Download Request

```bash
GET https://localhost:7054/documents/b1c2d3e4-5678-90ab-cdef-1234567890ab
```

**Response Headers:**
```
Content-Type: application/pdf
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="drivers_license.pdf"
```

**Response:** Binary file content (streamed)

#### Using cURL

```bash
# Download and save to file
curl -o document.pdf "https://localhost:7054/documents/b1c2d3e4-5678-90ab-cdef-1234567890ab"

# Download with custom filename from server
curl -OJ "https://localhost:7054/documents/b1c2d3e4-5678-90ab-cdef-1234567890ab"
```

#### Using Postman

1. Set request method to `GET`
2. Set URL to `https://localhost:7054/documents/{file-id}`
3. Click **Send and Download** button
4. Choose save location

### Download Source Examples

#### 1. Download from Local File Store

Most common scenario - files stored on local disk:

```xml
<file_management>
  <store>primary</store>
</file_management>

<!-- SQL Query returns: -->
SELECT 
    'invoice_2025.pdf' AS file_name,
    '2025/Nov/11/a3d5e7f9-1234-5678-90ab-cdef12345678/invoice_2025.pdf' AS relative_path
FROM [files] WHERE id = @id;
```

The system combines the store's `base_path` (from `file_management.xml`) with `relative_path` to locate the file.

#### 2. Download from SFTP Server

For files stored on remote SFTP servers:

```xml
<file_management>
  <store>remote_storage</store>
</file_management>

<!-- SQL Query returns the same relative_path -->
SELECT 
    'contract.docx' AS file_name,
    '2025/Nov/11/b2c3d4e5-6789-01bc-def1-234567890abc/contract.docx' AS relative_path
FROM [files] WHERE id = @id;
```

The system automatically:
- Connects to the SFTP server using credentials from `file_management.xml`
- Locates the file by combining both `base_path` and `relative_path`
- Opens a stream to the SFTP file
- Streams it directly to the client with minimal memory usage (only an 81KB buffer)

#### 3. Download from Database (Base64)

For files stored directly in the database (no file store needed):

```xml
<response_structure>file</response_structure>

<file_management>
  <!-- Store configuration can be omitted entirely for base64 content -->
</file_management>

<!-- SQL Query returns base64 content -->
SELECT 
    'small_image.png' AS file_name,
    'image/png' AS content_type,
    base64_content  -- Column containing base64-encoded file
FROM [files] WHERE id = @id;
```

> **Note**: Only suitable for small files (< 1MB). Large files should use file stores for better performance.

#### 4. Proxy Download from HTTP/HTTPS URL

Forward downloads from external URLs (useful for CDNs or external storage):

```xml
<response_structure>file</response_structure>

<file_management>
  <!-- Store configuration can be omitted entirely for HTTP proxy -->
</file_management>

<!-- SQL Query returns HTTP URL -->
SELECT 
    'external_document.pdf' AS file_name,
    'https://cdn.example.com/documents/file-12345.pdf' AS http
FROM [files] WHERE id = @id;
```

The system:
- Fetches the file from the URL
- Streams it to the client
- Preserves the content type from the HTTP response

### Advanced Download Scenarios

#### Download with Access Control

Combine with local API keys for secure downloads:

```xml
<download_protected_document>
  <route>secure/documents/{{id}}</route>
  <verb>GET</verb>
  <response_structure>file</response_structure>
  <mandatory_parameters>id</mandatory_parameters>
  
  <!-- Require API key authentication -->
  <local_api_keys>
    <key>secret-document-key-12345</key>
  </local_api_keys>
  
  <file_management>
    <store>primary</store>
  </file_management>
  
  <query>
  <![CDATA[
    DECLARE @id UNIQUEIDENTIFIER = {{id}};
    DECLARE @user_id UNIQUEIDENTIFIER = {{user_id}}; -- From authenticated context
    
    -- Verify user has access to this document
    IF NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM [files] f
        INNER JOIN [contacts] c ON f.contact_id = c.id
        WHERE f.id = @id AND c.user_id = @user_id
    )
    BEGIN
        THROW 50403, 'Access denied to this document', 1; -- HTTP 403 Forbidden
        RETURN;
    END
    
    SELECT file_name, relative_path
    FROM [files] WHERE id = @id;
  ]]>
  </query>
</download_protected_document>
```

#### Download with Audit Logging

Track who downloads what:

```sql
DECLARE @id UNIQUEIDENTIFIER = {{id}};
DECLARE @downloaded_by NVARCHAR(100) = {{user_email}};

-- Log the download
INSERT INTO [download_audit] (file_id, downloaded_by, downloaded_at)
VALUES (@id, @downloaded_by, GETDATE());

-- Return file metadata
SELECT file_name, relative_path
FROM [files] WHERE id = @id;
```

#### Dynamic Content Type Based on Client

Serve different file formats based on client preferences:

```sql
DECLARE @id UNIQUEIDENTIFIER = {{id}};
DECLARE @accept_header NVARCHAR(500) = {{Accept}}; -- HTTP Accept header

SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN @accept_header LIKE '%image/webp%' THEN 'image.webp'
        WHEN @accept_header LIKE '%image/png%' THEN 'image.png'
        ELSE 'image.jpg'
    END AS file_name,
    CASE 
        WHEN @accept_header LIKE '%image/webp%' THEN webp_path
        WHEN @accept_header LIKE '%image/png%' THEN png_path
        ELSE jpg_path
    END AS relative_path
FROM [file_variants] WHERE id = @id;
```

### Error Handling

The download feature handles common errors gracefully:

| Error | HTTP Status | When It Occurs |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| File not found in database | 404 | SQL query returns no rows or throws 50404 |
| File not found in store | 404 | `relative_path` doesn't exist in the file store |
| Access denied | 403 | SQL query throws 50403 |
| Invalid store configuration | 500 | Store referenced but not configured in `file_management.xml` |
| SFTP connection failure | 500 | Cannot connect to SFTP server |
| HTTP proxy error | 502 | External URL returns error or is unreachable |

### Performance Considerations

**Streaming Architecture**: All download methods use async streaming:
- Files are never fully loaded into memory
- 81KB buffer size for optimal performance
- Supports files of any size efficiently

**SFTP Connection Pooling**: Multiple downloads from the same SFTP server reuse connections when possible.

**Local File Caching**: Consider using a CDN or reverse proxy cache for frequently downloaded files.

**HTTP Proxy Mode**: Best for files already hosted on high-performance CDNs. The API acts as a secure gateway.

> **Production Tip**: For high-traffic scenarios with large files, consider implementing:
> - Signed URLs with expiration (generate temporary direct download links)
> - CDN integration for static files
> - Range request support for resumable downloads (partially supported by ASP.NET Core automatically)

> **Security Note**: Always validate user permissions in your SQL query before returning file metadata. Never expose internal file paths to clients. Use GUIDs for file IDs rather than sequential integers.
